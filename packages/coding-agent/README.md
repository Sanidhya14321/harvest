## Memory backends

The agent supports three mutually-exclusive memory backends, selected via the `memory.backend` setting (Settings → Memory tab, or `~/.harvest/agent/config.yml`):

- `off` (default) — no memory subsystem runs.
- `local` — existing rollout-summarisation pipeline; writes `memory_summary.md` and consolidated artifacts under the agent dir.
- `hindsight` — talks to a [Hindsight](https://hindsight.vectorize.io) server (Cloud or self-hosted Docker), retains transcripts every Nth user turn, recalls memories on the first turn of a session, and exposes `retain`, `recall`, and `reflect`.

### Hindsight quickstart

1. Run a Hindsight server (Cloud or `docker run -p 8888:8888 ghcr.io/vectorize-io/hindsight:latest`).
2. Set `memory.backend = "hindsight"` and `hindsight.apiUrl = "http://localhost:8888"` (or your Cloud URL).
3. Optional environment overrides (env wins over settings):
   - `HINDSIGHT_API_URL`, `HINDSIGHT_API_TOKEN` — connection
   - `HINDSIGHT_BANK_ID`, `HINDSIGHT_DYNAMIC_BANK_ID`, `HINDSIGHT_AGENT_NAME` — bank addressing
   - `HINDSIGHT_AUTO_RECALL`, `HINDSIGHT_AUTO_RETAIN`, `HINDSIGHT_RETAIN_MODE` — lifecycle
   - `HINDSIGHT_RECALL_BUDGET`, `HINDSIGHT_RECALL_MAX_TOKENS` — recall sizing
   - `HINDSIGHT_BANK_MISSION`, `HINDSIGHT_DEBUG`

Switching backends mid-session immediately replaces the live backend, memory tools, listeners, and system-prompt context. Existing users with `memories.enabled = true|false` are migrated to `memory.backend = "local"|"off"` exactly once on first launch; afterward, `memory.backend` is the sole runtime selector.

## Local Decision Layer (Laya — removed)

> **Removed:** the Laya local decision sidecar has been removed from
> runtime, packaging, setup, settings UI, and active docs. The
> `laya.enabled`, `laya.url`, and `laya.autostart` config keys are parsed
> but inert (no settings UI), `LAYA_ENABLED`, `LAYA_GATING`,
> `LAYA_SIDECAR_URL`, and `LAYA_TIMEOUT_MS` are ignored with one
> deprecation warning, and `/laya` reports the removal. High-risk tool
> calls fall through to the existing human-approval policy (fail closed —
> never blanket auto-approved); Markdown-brain retrieval uses
> lexical/graph order with no rerank step; model selection is explicit.
> Prior Laya user data (logs, calibration, model cache) is left in place —
> delete manually if unwanted. See [Decision Layer Guide](../../docs/decision-layer.md).
